# üîç OSINT Source Evaluation: Chinese Naval Technologies

This document identifies and evaluates key publicly available sources for gathering open-source intelligence (OSINT) on Chinese naval technologies. The goal is to support further HUMINT, CI, CP, and FI analysis by structuring credible, diverse, and strategically valuable sources.

While I could not get Flowise to query my various API keys and link together the structured data, I sketched out my initial process.

See below for an example workflow leveraging OSINT sources, their outputs, and future mechanisms for enriching and visualizing the data. Data is structured in a CSV for easy parsing and integration with diverse tools like Python, pandas, Tableau, Elastic/Kibana, AI agents, etc. As it grows, it would make sense to restructure the database to one with better scalability, read/write accessibility and speed, and possibly a graph database like Neo4j.
